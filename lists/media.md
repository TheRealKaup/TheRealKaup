# Notes

I review media here with emphasis on narrative and storytelling. Media usually includes video games and shows.

I prefer reviewing media shortly after finishing them, which is why media I consume before this file was created aren't rated here. This is because I rate media based on the final feeling/impression I got from the ending of each piece, which is short-lived. This rule doesn't always apply, sometimes I decide to add an item to the list weeks after, or after rewatching/replaying it for the second or third time (sometimes changing its rating if it was listed here already); this is because I like to rate things.

As for games, I default to watching playthroughs rather than actually playing them. I revert to playing when the gameplay itself looks appealing, or, when dialogue isn't voiced nor there is a creator I like that reads it out loud, or, when I want my full attention on the game.

## Omori

Entry from 9-5-2024

Watched CallMeCarson's playthrough.

I recommend CallMeCarson's playthrough if you like the niche content creator, the narration is really nice and he covers a significant portion of the optional content, though hide the chat from the VODs as it contains spoilers sometimes. Also, I've found I had to pay more attention than I've initially expected, because the scenes change quite quickly, dialogue is frequent and the more important bits blend with the others. I thought of switching from watching to playing the game a couple of times because my attention was already mostly drawn into it, but I didn't, and I'm happy I didn't, as the actual walking-simulator-like gameplay experience isn't my cup of tee.

<details>
  <summary>
    Spoilers:
  </summary>

  So far the best written game I've experienced. In fact, the reason I created this file.

  CallMeCarson got the good ending with the secret Basil and Sunny cutscene at the end, which is basically the best way to experience the game for the first time. This leads to the other reason I'm happy I've watched his playthrough rather than stop and play the game myself, because in 3 days left I would have ignored Kel and missed the entire day.

  The way the game makes the initial main plot (Basil's disappearance) feel less important is phenomenal. Making the experiencer grasp to that plot line only for the characters to almost forget about it in the Last Resort, and then for the game to completely forsake it and reveal the truth in the last 2-3 hours of the game, punched really well. Headspace is reduced to Sunny's mechanism for ignoring the truth; Basil finding the picture containing a piece of it is the reason for his disappearance, and the rest of the characters forgetting about Basil is an additional measure the system takes to maintain the mechanism.

  I've read somewhere about a theory that Mari died only from the hanging, I didn't dive deeper into it as I admittedly intentionally don't want to encounter convincing evidence for that, but if Basil knew how to tie a hangman's knot and came up with the entire plan on the place, they probably also knew to check if Mari was actually dead. I don't see why it wouldn't be possible that she died form the fall; I recall that she had a permanent knee injury and landed on the violin, could have fallen and landed really badly.

  While Basil was capable of his doings, he was not able to fully comprehend them. Simply too young to understand the meaning difference between taking one's own life and an accident. Basil's plan was in good will, only for it to severely traumatize the two. The regrettable framing was what made the tragedy so much more poignant; the characters could never understand why, for that the tragedy lingered so harshly in their minds.

  Isolation seems like a fake way to deal with things, but it's easy to take and sometimes I used to find it hard to decline. Seeing Sunny's condition truly saddens me.

  On a final note, the bond between Sunny and Basil, is perfectly composed.

# A; Excellent

## Until Then

Entry from 2-9-2024

Played myself (it's a visual novel with no narration).

<details>
  <summary>
    Spoilers:
  </summary>

  Until Then establishes a wonderful narrative, but falls for some really unfortunate mistakes:

  1. Letting parts of the story be driven by dull characters (namely, Jake and Maria).
  2. Merely involving badly written characters (such as Nicole's parents and Carlo).
  3. Characters being annoying empaths (that is, overreacting on every singular crumb of grief shared by another character).

  When you've got such a good story, avoid poorly designed and meaningless characters and interactions at all cost, for they can really damage the overall quality of the story. In the case of Until Then, this can be done by simply not adding said characters and interactiosn to begin with; the game has enough without them.

  There are 2 main plot points to the ending that players seem to attract attention to the most: the fates of Cath and the relationship of Mark and Nicole. I frankly didn't care all that much about what will end up with Mark and Nicole, though it was conveyed well and standalone it would correspondingly get a B. Cath's story was exceptional, and standalone I would give it an S.

  The conundrum is that these storylines must coexist for at least the success of Cath's storyline. The looping lifespans of Mark and Nicole provide that frustrating yearning to save Cath which is exactly that necessary component Cath's storyline is relying on.

  While deciding on a final rating for the game, it doesn't seem quite right to just ignore major parts I didn't like as much, especially when they are of the resolution. I might have given the game an S if Cath was just the foremost thing the game would sign off with, which is a change completely possible applying to the game by making all things seem to lead to Cath being finally saved.

  I also don't get what there is to cope with from Mark's and Nicole's ending (as people seem to do in the subreddit). They literally lived 100 lives together, why does it matter that they live 101?

## Death Note

Second time watching it made me want to rate it. I will not be reviewing it here.

## Crime and Punishment

I don't remember what exact edition I read. It was a while ago. I just really liked the story. I just thought it would be hilarious to rank it here.

## The Last of Us Part II

    Spoilers:
  </summary>

  A criticism I've heard is about the lack of character development. This is true, none of the characters developed in a way that felt meaningful.

  Yet TLoU2 left with a powerful ending without character development. This is the first time I recognize a good story that its characters don't overcome challenging circumstances by changing. They actually don't overcome challenging circumstances in the first place. Rather, they stay the same, stuck in their perpetual cycle of retaliation, refusing to let go of their motives. This, is the opposite of character development; this, is the destruction of characters.

## Doki Doki Literature Club!

Entry from 20-5-2024. Updated 4-22-2025.

Played first. Updated entry after watching gavintino's playthrough. I recommend watching the playthrough if you like the creator.

<details>
  <summary>
    Spoilers:
  </summary>

  I believe the main motif was not finger-sucking, but in fact suffering distributed across repeating and short-lasting iterations of restarted characters. How about that as a concise explanation? Put that in your pipe and smoke it. A scene that expresses this motif well is when Natsuki, at the end of the second act, returns to class after the weekend, completely unaware of anything that previously happened, sees Yuri's corpse, throws up and immediately gets deleted.

  The second act is weakpoint, while initially experiencing the game. I dislked it for its meta, which I consider inherently cheap beacuse it sets aside all the characters throughout the second act, who the game worked so hard on developing throughout the first act. I'm absolutely not suggesting that this should have been changed, what wouldn't make any sense: it defines the game because it's necessary for the motif (which I am fond of). Designing a story is a matter of settling on the most important concepts you want to express, deducing which further concepts are necessary to express for those main concepts, and then choosing additional (non-contradictory) concepts based on overall utility (that is, which set of extra concepts intensifies and supplements the main concepts and the overall experience to the furthest extent). What I'm pointing out is that specifically the meta concept (which I think was necessary for the creator to express what they wanted in the game), greatly manifested throughout the second act, which ultimately made me favor it less, at least while actually experiencing it (and not specifically while re-evaluating it in retrospect). Simply put: if the characters are unaffected by the horror and there's only repetitive and gratuitous jumpscares, then why should I bother?

  </summary>

  Updating the review (which is something I prefer not doing, but watching the game again made me really want to rephrase it), also reminded me of Until Then, which implemented the recurring-acts thing much better (beacuse the characters acknowledge it the further they go, and there are much more changes between each repetition hence more replayability). Generally, Until Then is definitely a better game, considering it conveys a richer and longer plot.

## ENA: Dream BBQ (chapter 1)

Played and watched gavintino's playthrough. I recommend watching his playthrough if you like the creator.

<details>
  <summary>
    Spoilers:
  </summary>

  I found it a bit tricky to rank a slice-of-life game that pretty much makes no sense. It's pretty interesting: having this virtually incoherent plot didn't make me think that the plot is bad, it just made me think "I don't get it" and shift my full attention to storytelling (character interactions; visuals; music). Usually when I rank a game, I split it to 2, plot and storytelling, rank each, and roughly use the mean. My point is, with this "game", the "plot" is not 0, but rather neutral, because it looks like it's expressing something, but I don't really know what, so who am I to think that it's a "bad" "plot". Peak rationalization. Anyway, it's pretty good.

  The gameplay (although not the focus of this file) surely could have been better (and will certainly improve, being the first chapter). Still, a video game is always the ultimate format, especially for ENA which works very well with easter-eggs and whatnot.

  Also, this is an opportunity to express my thoughts on releasing games in chapters (this game, for example). I like it. It allows smaller productions to reach disproportionately-high qualities while not abandoning development before anything is released, and makes each chapter progressively better due to reviews and expansion in production based on income from past chapters. I'm even fond of forgetting about the game between each chapter (AKA "losing hype"), and check on it once in a while until I realize a new chapter was (or is about) to be released. This is not because I like "losing interest" in things (which is not what's happening here), but because I have a life, and I prefer having the things I like extend for more time in the duration of that life. By "extend", I mean introduce new content, not just echo in time and space after being considered finished.

## Attack on Titan

Entry from 2-12-2025

<details>
  <summary>
    Spoilers (and slightly to Frieren season 1, Death Note and Crime and Punishment):
  </summary>

  There were a couple of episodes that were truly excellent. For example, the couple of episodes which end with basil burning to death or whatever.

  However, I thought the ending was overcomplicated, and was just a "let's throw a bunch of plot elements to make a grand ending". Frieren season 1 did this as well where for some reason the last couple of minutes were: something happens, flashback to a character saying that they know that this thing will happen, another something happens, flashback again. I don't get it, I think it's stupid and has nothing to do with anything. What Death Note, and something like Crime and Punishment, do really well is throw at you all of the complicated plot throughout the story but hit you with a straightforward, simple ending that directly hits the pain point that the story is trying to push, and that's something AOT misses.

  I enjoyed most of the series and overcome the cringe af anime elements like a champ. So it still gets a strong B, it is great.

</details>

## Solo Leveling (seasons 1-2)

Entry from 2-12-2025

<details>
  <summary>
    Spoilers (and to Invincible, and fucking House I guess):
  </summary>

  This show took me by surprise. I go for the "5 episode rule" where I watch the first 5 episodes and decide if I continue from there (this rule only works for shows with short episodes). It only passed the 5 episode rule because I really had nothing else to do that day and then I ended up watching it pretty much in a single seating and enjoyed it greatly. Hence it is great.

  Not sure if I really like this genre though, there are just scenes where I went "what the fuck am I even looking at" as Jinwoo ends his absurd fight that makes no sense with a punch that generates a nuclear explosion or whatever. This is contrary to Invincible which does it differently (it's not necessarily better, it's just something different), and I prefer that. Taking Invincible season 3 episode 8 as an example, throughout the episode you can get an approximation of each character's strength, exertion and fatigue, which add another layer to the viewing experience which I feel is generally missing in Solo Leveling (but that's fine, instead we get hella visuals and cool stuff).

  While not perfectly analogous, this does remind me of the problem I had with House, where I couldn't actually understand whether the problem at hand is difficult and constitutes a challenge to the characters that will make them struggle, because I am not a fucking doctor, literally the entire episode is a pile of random technical words which mean nothing to me, what is the point in watching this shit.

# C; Decent

From this tier and below I wouldn't consider anything here worth the time.

## Firewatch

Entry from 17-5-2024

Played myself. I recommend watching instead (if you are interested in the game, I don't consider it worth it).

<details>
  <summary>
    Spoilers:
  </summary>

  I felt like playing a short game that is light on gameplay, overshot, and got myself the definition of a walking simulator, a genre I absolutely despise playing.

  Story's fine and unoffensive. The "twist that there is no twist" is cool, though works best for a specific set of players. Players who insufficiently emotionally connected with the characters will find it underwhelming (as I did a bit), players who want there to be a twist will be disappointed, and players who don't meet these two conditions will likely fancy it.

  The game's strong suit is unquestionably the storytelling. It's genuinely just great. I adore the concept of faceless characters, and this game conveyed it excellently. For this reason, combined with how stupid I found the deceptively foreshadowed conspiracy twist, I was satisfied by the ending after all.

# D; Mediocre

## Uncharted 1, 2, 3 and 4

Entry from 11-5-2024

Watched without commentary.

<details>
  <summary>
    Spoilers:
  </summary>

  I recall hearing the story of Uncharted was worth watching. After doing so, I can tell these games are focused more on gameplay than narrative, and the story never really shines. But, the chemistry between the characters, which I felt more present in the first 3 games, was still quite fun to place in the background.

  Uncharted 4 was a bit too long. Credit is where credit's due, its new antagonists and the fight between Rafe and Nathan at the end of the game were quite well written. The ending scene with Nathan's and Elana's daughter was the opposite, though. I really don't understand why they forced that into the game, especially considering the ending so far was as good as one could expect from such narrative.

</details>

## Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion

Entry from 4-12-2025

<details>
  <summary>
    Spoilers (and for Death Note):
  </summary>

  This show does not live up to its popularity. I really did not like it.

  I want to quote a paragraph from the description on episode 21, season 2, "The Ragnarok Connection":

  > Lelouch counters that such a world would be gentle only for his parents and is nothing like what Nunnally wanted. Suzaku inwardly muses that Lelouch might be telling the truth, recalling how both Euphemia and Shirley never revealed Lelouch's identity as Zero, even till the end. Charles says that even if Lelouch is right, it doesn't matter since he's too late to prevent Ragnarök, but Lelouch points out that he's Zero, "the man who works miracles", and removes his contact lens. Charles states that his Geass is useless now, as it cannot affect him or anyone else present. Lelouch then corrects him, pointing out there's someone he hasn't accounted for: C's World, which is the will of humanity itself. He then fires one of Charles's quotes back at him: "All men are not created equal." Lelouch claims that because of that, Charles can understand that his Geass will work. Charles calls Lelouch foolish, saying that the power of kings can't defeat the gods. Lelouch corrects him again, saying that he doesn't want to fight the gods, but only make a request to them. He then looks up at the image of Jupiter, declaring that he now knows who he truly is. Using his Geass, Lelouch communicates with the collective unconscious, begging the gods to not stop the progress of time.

  While serving an extreme example, the entire plot of the this show makes no fucking sense and is utterly stupid. While, for the most part, you can understand what is happening and verbally explain each plot point and what caused it, throughout the show **causality** is random and things happen solely to serve the plot. Everything is overcomplicated and as a result everything is filled with holes, which may not be inherently contradictory, but rather they make you think "literally anything else could have happened". At no point during the show I felt anxious about what is going to occur next because it always going to end the way Lelouch planned and at no point something suggests otherwise. For example, how come Schneizel got outsmarted by Lelouch at the end? No clue, period.

  Considering this world behaves randomly, Lelouch's plans are against the laws of logic, hence he is omniscient. Then why does Lelouch die at the end? I have no fucking idea, a [Genghis Gambit](https://tropedia.fandom.com/wiki/Genghis_Gambit) is just a wrong choice for an ending. Literally nothing can defeat Lelouch, he simply decided to end the story this way, and just as he planned a bittersweet ending, he could have planned a happy ending. Based on the premise that causality in this show is random, it is impossible to refute this argument, thus it is true.

  Furthermore, the characters are shallow and are as badly written as the plot. I hate anime fluff and this show is packing with it. Characters go "this is just a single unit, I will go right at it!" while their literal commander goes "no! don't do it!" as they disobey their orders and fucking die, this, 10 times each episode. The art style is unappealing. A good portion of the sentences end like this, then. This might be only in the English dub, but I am certain reading English subtitles would be a worse experience, so. Once you notice it really gets on your nevers, however.

  Naturally, I will compare it to Death Note. Death Note is a wonderful example of logical plot writing. Once you get your plot to be logical (as well as psychological, which is probably the toughest part), you can proceed with storytelling and production. Code Geass failed the first step, so instead of logical it just seems random, which means the viewing experience will be at least boring. Let me use an example that will help clarify why it works this way, though this will work as long as your are not a medical doctor: go watch an episode of House unless you've already done so. You will notice how because you don't understand the technical terms and how medicine works at a professional level, you don't actually understand the challenge which the characters are facing and the plot points seem **random**. Watching House will be a boring experience, unless you like the show's humor, or you are a fan of medical drama which likely means your are either an actual medical doctor or at least someone interested in medicine and know about it more than the average person (hence it won't seem completely random and it won't be boring), *or* you enjoy soap opera, in which case, this file is not relevant to you. I praise Death Note for being a proper psychological thriller: as you watch the show, your mind is racing to figure out what L has planned, and whether Light's move is going to achieve what he wants. Is Near's confidence really justified? Your brain is provided with a challenge and you think about the possibilities, and you are anxious because there are so many of them you must assume some assumption to narrow the options to something you can work on, use to plan and then take action. You understand that the main characters go through the same thing: they feel the dread of assuming the wrong assumptions, and when they are confident but lose, their world and their pride falls apart; the panic. This only works because the plot of Death Note is logical to begin with. If it wasn't logical, the show would continue disappointing you because whatever comes next is random, so your processing of what happened so far was for nothing. While watching Code Geass, you will never say "no way, I didn't think of that!" or "nice, I knew that will happen!", instead, you will always think "what even happened, this relates to nothing, what is even the point, this is boring".

  Now for a different topic: world building. Death Note also knew in what to invest depth. Media, for example, is an aspect which Code Geass did not invest in all that much, while Death Note covered extensively. This isn't necessarily bad, obviously Code Geass doesn't have to be Death Note and specifically show how the media would be affected in such world. But, think **generally** about how much Death Note's decision to cover this aspect contributes to its world, and whether Code Geass benefited just as much from its decision to invest into *any other aspect*. It didn't, and also, note that Code Geass is a longer show, meaning it had more time to build a world. Code Geass selected nothing interesting to cover, it had no funny quirks, nothing to act as a tool to drive the story forward in an amusing way. At least not at the level of Death Note. Take anything from Code Geass that doesn't exist as the main plot line and compare it to [Sakura TV](https://deathnote.fandom.com/wiki/Sakura_TV). Nothing is as dynamic and funny as Sakura TV; Sakura TV interacts with the world of Death Note and pivots the story in unique and authentic ways, whilst Code Geass is a massive and empty world. Death note is good, Code Geass is bad, the end.

<details>
  <summary>
    Spoilers:
  </summary>

  I can't believe the only good character in this game is a book.

  I've read that experiencing this game prior to _NieR: Automata_ is a good idea, and so I did.

  Things the game did well:
  - Weiss
  - Some of the side content; comedic, narrative-wise flows well with the main storyline
  - Conveying multiple endings

  Things I disliked about the game:
  - The tendancy of a character saying "yay!", gratuitously, inironically
  - The cursory open world
  - World design
  - Sudden long minutes of reading
  - Mindless sexualization of a character
  - NieRly all main storyline characters; uncompelling
  - General plot; underwhelming
  - Music
  - Character naming

  I am not implying that anything of the listed is "bad", not objectively, not subjectively. I'm an anti-realist, anyway. Put simply, the game isn't for me.

  </summary>

  Watched the game to learn more about mascot horrors. Its plot is as uninspired as the rest. Also, the art style is not particularly attractive, and is frequently interrupted by anything made of ink (especially the enemies). The moment I knew this game was bad was when the protagonist unironically commented "another day another dollar"; voice acting and the script are in accordance to the game's ranking. Furthermore, it can't be called a horror game, as it's not even remotely scary, obviously due to the sound and visual design.

  Update from 2-12-2025: I thought about the meaning of a "horrible game" recently. Originally I thought something like Garten of Banban would be it, but, those game or just bad because they are still somewhat amusing if you find the right streamer to commentate while playing it. No, a **horrible game** is one which you feel FOMO for not staring at a wall while you play it. Like, a game which makes you physically feel the minutes of your lifespan being wasted as you play it. It's a terrifying feeling, true fear. Now, I was watching a gameplay of this game while doing something else, I wasn't playing it. But if I was playing it, it would be horrible.

# General Opinions

## Side Content

Entry from 11-5-2024

The side content of GTA 5 features comedic, goofy characters. These side missions and the rest of San Andres have a lovable, thrilling charm, that is considerably distinct from the feel of the main content. You can trip out and hallucinate shooting clowns in a side mission, and then in a main mission commit torture, as the same character. The two scenes work well together because they provide contrast for each other. A wonderful example that doesn't work so well is Cyberpunk 2077.

Most of the side content in Cyberpunk 2077 attempts to provoke deep emotional responses, unsuccessfully. A side quest may have multiple parts, serious topics, a moral dilemma and choices, yet here I am following the fandom wiki to get the iconic weapon I want or the highest payment, unable to care less about this murderer character that now doubts he is the messiah. Johnny persuading the player to act according to his views may affect the player's choices, but the side quest still isn't compelling. With these failed attempts, adverse outcomes affect the main storyline itself:
- The world is blown out of proportion by inserting gratuitously complex conundrums, that regardless, are unexciting.
- The involved main characters feel fake by overreacting, with the aim to make the player care more about the side events.

Even when done successfully, this kind of side content can reduce the importance of the main storyline, potentially weakening it.

Comedic side content, on the other hand, can be done well with less steps, while emphasizing the tragic, main storyline via contrast, without affecting it or its characters directly.

I'm not sure what's preferable in a case where humorous side content doesn't fit. Perhaps abandoning side content altogether and going for a completely linear storyline, or separating side content into a small amount of quests that are long enough to achieve their dramatic purpose, is the way to go.

In a sense, this is a matter of quality over quantity. To make more serious side content, quality is tramendously more important than quantity. Comedic side content allows for more quantity, which, for instance, can benefit open world games.

## RPGs

Entry from 11-5-2024

When I play a good RPG, I would want to experience the entirety of its content, or at least the story as intended in my first playthrough. This is intentionally designed to be problematic, as experiencing everything, or the story as intended after failing to do so in the first time, means to replay the game, in some cases multiple times, repeating hours of gameplay while only changing a couple of minutes by doing certain activities differently. RPGs in their nature manipulate the story based on the player's actions. Removing this feature of RPGs and instead offering a completely immutable storyline solves the issue, at the cost of going against the point of RPGs.

The solution: when starting the game, let the player choose between a mutable and an immutable playthrough. The immutable playthrough will convey the story as intended, appealing to new players who wish to avoid accidentally ruining their initial experience of the story. The mutable playthrough will convey the game to its fullest extent, appealing to players who want to dive deeper into the lore and see for themselves how the plot is affected following certain choices.

## Branching

Entry from 14-5-2024

It is usually said that alternative endings are there to enhance player agency in a story. For instance, letting the player choose with whom to end the game allows the player to control the story with their preferences. This functions only if the sum stays the same on the happy-to-sad axis across all said endings, as was done in Cyberpunk 2077.

Cyberpunk 2077 also offers the bad ending, which is distinctively more tragic. No player is satisfied after finishing the game with it, forcing the player to change their initial course of action to obtain one of the more satisfying endings, effectively betraying their agency.

This allows the writer to provide one or more horrifically tragic closings to the plot, even if they hold a trait that would disqualify them from being acceptable resolutions to the story. In a non-branching narrative this would not be allowed, as the experiencer would simply rage at the writer for writing what they did, like the tale as old as time of The Last of Us Part II's release. It is allowed in branching games, as the player or the writer themselves can simply refer to the ending they found most satisfying as the "true ending", but note: the player has sacrificed their agency long ago to experience all of the endings. Choosing which resolution they liked most tells them which path they would have taken, but not which path they had.

Having an excessively tragic, or maybe even comedic "fake ending", provides contrast to the "true ending", making the latter more satisfying and emphasizing its realism and happy or sad outcomes. This, I think, is the biggest utility alternative endings can produce.

Player agency can perhaps be implemented more reliabely via player choices such as ones which only affect the character's following reaction, that itself is trivial to the story. One option can treat said character kindly and the second option unkindly. The player, if they already formed an opinion about the character, will likely stand with their choice if they replay the game, because choosing otherwise will feel bad or undeserved.

Still, this perspective leaves the concept of player agency weakened to an extent I doubt its even there. It's worth mentioning that there are games that have so many choices, it's virtually impossible to experience all distinct paths and thus eliminate player agency.
