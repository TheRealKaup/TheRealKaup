# Notes

I review games here with emphasis on narrative and storytelling. I default to watching playthroughs rather than actually playing games. I revert to playing when the gameplay itself looks appealing, or, when dialogue isn't voiced not there is a creator I like that reads it out loud, or, when I want my full attention on the game.

I prefer reviewing games shortly after finishing them, which is why games I played before the file aren't reviewd here.

## Omori

Entry from 9-5-2024

Watched CallMeCarson's playthrough.

I recommend CallMeCarson's playthrough if you like the niche content creator, the narration is really nice and he covers a significant portion of the optional content, though hide the chat from the VODs as it contains spoilers sometimes. Also, I've found I had to pay more attention than I've initially expected, because the scenes change quite quickly, dialogue is frequent and the more important bits blend with the others. I thought of switching from watching to playing the game a couple of times because my attention was already mostly drawn into it, but I didn't, and I'm happy I didn't, as the actual walking-simulator-like gameplay experience isn't my cup of tee.

<details>
  <summary>
    Spoilers:
  </summary>

  So far the best written game I've experienced. In fact, the reason I created this file.

  CallMeCarson got the good ending with the secret Basil and Sunny cutscene at the end, which is basically the best way to experience the game for the first time. This leads to the other reason I'm happy I've watched his playthrough rather than stop and play the game myself, because in 3 days left I would have ignored Kel and missed the entire day.

  The way the game makes the initial main plot (Basil's disappearance) feel less important is phenomenal. Making the experiencer grasp to that plot line only for the characters to almost forget about it in the Last Resort, and then for the game to completely forsake it and reveal the truth in the last 2-3 hours of the game, punched really well. Headspace is reduced to Sunny's mechanism for ignoring the truth; Basil finding the picture containing a piece of it is the reason for his disappearance, and the rest of the characters forgetting about Basil is an additional measure the system takes to maintain the mechanism.

  I've read somewhere about a theory that Mari died only from the hanging, I didn't dive deeper into it as I admittedly intentionally don't want to encounter convincing evidence for that, but if Basil knew how to tie a hangman's knot and came up with the entire plan on the place, they probably also knew to check if Mari was actually dead. I don't see why it wouldn't be possible that she died form the fall; I recall that she had a permanent knee injury and landed on the violin, could have fallen and landed really badly.

  While Basil was capable of his doings, he was not able to fully comprehend them. Simply too young to understand the meaning difference between taking one's own life and an accident. Basil's plan was in good will, only for it to severely traumatize the two. The regrettable framing was what made the tragedy so much more poignant; the characters could never understand why, for that the tragedy lingered so harshly in their minds.

  Isolation seems like a fake way to deal with things, but it's easy to take and sometimes I used to find it hard to decline. Seeing Sunny's condition truly saddens me.

  On a final note, the bond between Sunny and Basil, is perfectly composed.

## Until Then

Entry from 2-9-2024

Played myself (it's a visual novel with no narration).

<details>
  <summary>
    Spoilers:
  </summary>

  Until Then establishes a wonderful narrative, but falls for some really unfortunate mistakes:

  1. Letting parts of the story be driven by dull characters (namely, Jake and Maria).
  2. Merely involving badly written characters (such as Nicole's parents and Carlo).
  3. Characters being annoying empaths (that is, overreacting on every singular crumb of grief shared by another character).

  When you've got such a good story, avoid poorly designed and meaningless characters and interactions at all cost, for they can really damage the overall quality of the story. In the case of Until Then, this can be done by simply not adding said characters and interactiosn to begin with; the game has enough without them.

  There are 2 main plot points to the ending that players seem to attract attention to the most: the fates of Cath and the relationship of Mark and Nicole. I frankly didn't care all that much about what will end up with Mark and Nicole, though it was conveyed well and standalone it would correspondingly get a B. Cath's story was exceptional, and standalone I would give it an S.

  The conundrum is that these storylines must coexist for at least the success of Cath's storyline. The looping lifespans of Mark and Nicole provide that frustrating yearning to save Cath which is exactly that necessary component Cath's storyline is relying on.

  While deciding on a final rating for the game, it doesn't seem quite right to just ignore major parts I didn't like as much, especially when they are of the resolution. I might have given the game an S if Cath was just the foremost thing the game would sign off with, which is a change completely possible applying to the game by making all things seem to lead to Cath being finally saved.

  I also don't get what there is to cope with from Mark's and Nicole's ending (as people seem to do in the subreddit). They literally lived 100 lives together, why does it matter that they live 101?

## The Last of Us Part II

  A criticism I've heard is about the lack of character development. This is true, none of the characters developed in a way that felt meaningful.

  Yet TLoU2 left with a powerful ending without character development. This is the first time I recognize a good story that its characters don't overcome challenging circumstances by changing. They actually don't overcome challenging circumstances in the first place. Rather, they stay the same, stuck in their perpetual cycle of retaliation, refusing to let go of their motives. This, is the opposite of character development; this, is the destruction of characters.

## Doki Doki Literature Club!

Entry from 20-5-2024

Played. It's a visual novel, so it doesn't make much sense to watch instead.

<details>
  <summary>
    Spoilers:
  </summary>

  The game foreshadowed a bittersweet ending and intentionally concluded tragically. It basically tells you that everything meant nothing, nobody had free will so in fact it was all fake, and the characters can simply be restarted on demand to function as they were programmed; to love the protagonist for no meaningful reason.

  Although the lack of free will, the characters were still sentient. Sayori was forced to enter depression and kill herself. Yuri was forced to become insane, cut and stab herself. Natsuki got her neck broken and was given an abusive background. The protagonist witnessed everyone suffer and die. The characters turned cruel to each other; "Natsuki, no one cares. Why don't you go look for some coins under the vending machines or something?". Restarting the characters doesn't delete these events but rather let them happen again. This ridiculous volume of suffering distributed across short-lasting iterations of innocent characters makes the psychological horror successful. A scene that expresses this motif well is when Natsuki, at the end of the second act, returns to class after the weekend, completely unaware of anything that previously happened, sees Yuri's corpse, throws up and immediately gets deleted.

  Starting the game, everything felt rudimentary. The game conveyed to an extent that this feeling is provoked intentionally, such as by describing Natsuki's analogous manga as "moe". The first act of the story is supposed to be simple, serving only to generate sympathy that will be utilized much later. But then the following act maintained poor quality and felt forced. As not even the protagonist was acknowledging the jumpscares, the section was left to be deducted as entirely meta. Meta is cheap; if the characters are unaffected by the events and only the repetitive and gratuitous jumpscares remain, then why should I bother?

  For this I was surprised to acquire the perspective I hold now. If I were to write this entry right after finishing the game, I would likely place it at C. It managed to go up to here after lingering for a day, but this is as far as it can reach, considering the time itself spent with the characters wasn't exactly outstanding.

## ENA: Dream BBQ (chapter 1)

Played and watched gavintino's playthrough. I recommend watching his playthrough if you like the creator.

<details>
  <summary>
    Spoilers:
  </summart>

  I found it a bit tricky to rank a slice-of-life game that pretty much makes no sense. It's pretty interesting: having this virtually incoherent plot didn't make me think that the plot is bad, it just made me think "I don't get it" and shift my full attention to storytelling (character interactions; visuals; music). Usually when I rank a game, I split it to 2, plot and storytelling, rank each, and roughly use the mean. My point is, with this "game", the "plot" is not 0, but rather neutral, because it looks like it's expressing something, but I don't really know what, so who am I to think that it's a "bad" "plot". Peak rationalization. Anyway, it's pretty good.

  The gameplay (although not the focus of this file) surely could have been better (and will certainly improve, being the first chapter). Still, a video game is always the ultimate format, especially for ENA which works very well with easter-eggs and whatnot.

  Also, this is an opportunity to express my thoughts on releasing games in chapters (this game, for example). I like it. It allows smaller productions to reach disproportionately-high qualities while not abandoning development before anything is released, and makes each chapter progressively better due to reviews and expansion in production based on income from past chapters. I'm even fond of forgetting about the game between each chapter (AKA "losing hype"), and check on it once in a while until I realize a new chapter was (or is about) to be released. This is not because I like "losing interest" in things (which is not what's happening here), but because I have a life, and I prefer having the things I like extend for more time in the duration of that life. By "extend", I mean introduce new content, not just echo in time and space after being considered finished.

## Firewatch

Played myself. I recommend watching instead.

  I felt like playing a short game that is light on gameplay, overshot, and got myself the definition of a walking simulator, a genre I absolutely despise playing.

  Story's fine and unoffensive. The "twist that there is no twist" is cool, though works best for a specific set of players. Players who insufficiently emotionally connected with the characters will find it underwhelming (as I did a bit), players who want there to be a twist will be disappointed, and players who don't meet these two conditions will likely fancy it.

  The game's strong suit is unquestionably the storytelling. It's genuinely just great. I adore the concept of faceless characters, and this game conveyed it excellently. For this reason, combined with how stupid I found the deceptively foreshadowed conspiracy twist, I was satisfied by the ending after all.

  I recall hearing the story of Uncharted was worth watching. After doing so, I can tell these games are focused more on gameplay than narrative, and the story never really shines. But, the chemistry between the characters, which I felt more present in the first 3 games, was still quite fun to place in the background.

  Uncharted 4 was a bit too long. Credit is where credit's due, its new antagonists and the fight between Rafe and Nathan at the end of the game were quite well written. The ending scene with Nathan's and Elana's daughter was the opposite, though. I really don't understand why they forced that into the game, especially considering the ending so far was as good as one could expect from such narrative.

## NieR Replicant

  </summary>

  I can't believe the only good character in this game is a book.

  I've read that experiencing this game prior to _NieR: Automata_ is a good idea, and so I did.

  Things the game did well:
  - Weiss
  - Some of the side content; comedic, narrative-wise flows well with the main storyline
  - Conveying multiple endings

  Things I disliked about the game:
  - The tendancy of a character saying "yay!", gratuitously, inironically
  - The cursory open world
  - World design
  - Sudden long minutes of reading
  - Mindless sexualization of a character
  - NieRly all main storyline characters; uncompelling
  - General plot; underwhelming
  - Music
  - Character naming

  I am not implying that anything of the listed is "bad", not objectively, not subjectively. I'm an anti-realist, anyway. Put simply, the game isn't for me.

  Watched the game to learn more about mascot horrors. Its plot is as uninspired as the rest. Also, the art style is not particularly attractive, and is frequently interrupted by anything made of ink (especially the enemies). The moment I knew this game was bad was when the protagonist unironically commented "another day another dollar"; voice acting and the script are in accordance to the game's ranking. Furthermore, it can't be called a horror game, as it's not even remotely scary, obviously due to the sound and visual design.

## Side Content

Entry from 11-5-2024

The side content of GTA 5 features comedic, goofy characters. These side missions and the rest of San Andres have a lovable, thrilling charm, that is considerably distinct from the feel of the main content. You can trip out and hallucinate shooting clowns in a side mission, and then in a main mission commit torture, as the same character. The two scenes work well together because they provide contrast for each other. A wonderful example that doesn't work so well is Cyberpunk 2077.

Most of the side content in Cyberpunk 2077 attempts to provoke deep emotional responses, unsuccessfully. A side quest may have multiple parts, serious topics, a moral dilemma and choices, yet here I am following the fandom wiki to get the iconic weapon I want or the highest payment, unable to care less about this murderer character that now doubts he is the messiah. Johnny persuading the player to act according to his views may affect the player's choices, but the side quest still isn't compelling. With these failed attempts, adverse outcomes affect the main storyline itself:
- The world is blown out of proportion by inserting gratuitously complex conundrums, that regardless, are unexciting.
- The involved main characters feel fake by overreacting, with the aim to make the player care more about the side events.

Even when done successfully, this kind of side content can reduce the importance of the main storyline, potentially weakening it.

Comedic side content, on the other hand, can be done well with less steps, while emphasizing the tragic, main storyline via contrast, without affecting it or its characters directly.

I'm not sure what's preferable in a case where humorous side content doesn't fit. Perhaps abandoning side content altogether and going for a completely linear storyline, or separating side content into a small amount of quests that are long enough to achieve their dramatic purpose, is the way to go.

In a sense, this is a matter of quality over quantity. To make more serious side content, quality is tramendously more important than quantity. Comedic side content allows for more quantity, which, for instance, can benefit open world games.

## RPGs

Entry from 11-5-2024

When I play a good RPG, I would want to experience the entirety of its content, or at least the story as intended in my first playthrough. This is intentionally designed to be problematic, as experiencing everything, or the story as intended after failing to do so in the first time, means to replay the game, in some cases multiple times, repeating hours of gameplay while only changing a couple of minutes by doing certain activities differently. RPGs in their nature manipulate the story based on the player's actions. Removing this feature of RPGs and instead offering a completely immutable storyline solves the issue, at the cost of going against the point of RPGs.

The solution: when starting the game, let the player choose between a mutable and an immutable playthrough. The immutable playthrough will convey the story as intended, appealing to new players who wish to avoid accidentally ruining their initial experience of the story. The mutable playthrough will convey the game to its fullest extent, appealing to players who want to dive deeper into the lore and see for themselves how the plot is affected following certain choices.

## Branching

Entry from 14-5-2024

It is usually said that alternative endings are there to enhance player agency in a story. For instance, letting the player choose with whom to end the game allows the player to control the story with their preferences. This functions only if the sum stays the same on the happy-to-sad axis across all said endings, as was done in Cyberpunk 2077.

Cyberpunk 2077 also offers the bad ending, which is distinctively more tragic. No player is satisfied after finishing the game with it, forcing the player to change their initial course of action to obtain one of the more satisfying endings, effectively betraying their agency.

This allows the writer to provide one or more horrifically tragic closings to the plot, even if they hold a trait that would disqualify them from being acceptable resolutions to the story. In a non-branching narrative this would not be allowed, as the experiencer would simply rage at the writer for writing what they did, like the tale as old as time of The Last of Us Part II's release. It is allowed in branching games, as the player or the writer themselves can simply refer to the ending they found most satisfying as the "true ending", but note: the player has sacrificed their agency long ago to experience all of the endings. Choosing which resolution they liked most tells them which path they would have taken, but not which path they had.

Having an excessively tragic, or maybe even comedic "fake ending", provides contrast to the "true ending", making the latter more satisfying and emphasizing its realism and happy or sad outcomes. This, I think, is the biggest utility alternative endings can produce.

Player agency can perhaps be implemented more reliabely via player choices such as ones which only affect the character's following reaction, that itself is trivial to the story. One option can treat said character kindly and the second option unkindly. The player, if they already formed an opinion about the character, will likely stand with their choice if they replay the game, because choosing otherwise will feel bad or undeserved.

Still, this perspective leaves the concept of player agency weakened to an extent I doubt its even there. It's worth mentioning that there are games that have so many choices, it's virtually impossible to experience all distinct paths and thus eliminate player agency.
