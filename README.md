I'm a programmer who focuses on projects related to video games.\
I'm the developer of [KTech](#ktech), a C++ 2D terminal game engine library for GNU/Linux and Windows.\
I'm working on a video game called [netset](#netset), made with my game engine.\
I've recently opened a [journal for my essays](https://github.com/TheRealKaup/Journal).

## netset

A KTech game in active development. The player is a freelance hacker that gets jobs from the darknet. The game involves a networking simulation and a story line. The gameplay consists of searching for information, analyzing it and converting it into new information, until the goal is reached.

Here's a screenshot of the game, from 9.10.2023 (d/m/y):

## TextureCreator

An application made with KTech for creating cell-based texture files for KTech games. This program is required because each terminal character cell has an RGB foreground color, an RGB background color and a character. This kind of texture can't be created by a normal pixel-based image creator.
