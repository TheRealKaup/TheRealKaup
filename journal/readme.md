# Description

This journal directory keeps track of texts which I've read, such as scientific literature, software documentations and Wikipedia pages.
This `readme.md` file contains a glossary I use, and a list of texts which I'm currently in the process of reading.
Other files in this directory are for individual fields, and include what I already have read and what I might read in the future.
