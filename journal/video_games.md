# Notes 

This document is different than the other ones, as the titles listed are of video games rather than pieces of text, and I rate each entry, based on its narrative.

I also watch playthroughs, usually without commentary, instead of actually playing the video games, because I prefer to put them in the background and do something more productive in the foreground. Exceptions are detailed.

I have obviously played/watched more games that are unlisted here. I added only the ones that, since the creation of this list, my experience and memory of are still fresh, allowing me to give opinion.

Watched CallMeCarson's playthrough.

I recommend CallMeCarson's playthrough if you like the niche content creator, the narration is really nice and he covers a significant portion of the optional content, though hide the chat from the VODs as it contains spoilers sometimes. Also, I've found I had to pay more attention than I've initially expected, because the scenes change quite quickly, dialogue is frequent and the more important bits blend with the others. I thought of switching from watching to playing the game a couple of times because my attention was already mostly drawn into it, but I didn't and I'm happy I didn't, as the actual gameplay experience, which is somewhat remote to Undertale, isn't my cup of tee.

  So far the best written game I've experienced. In fact, the reason I created this file.

  CallMeCarson got the good ending with the secret Basil and Sunny cutscene at the end, which is basically the best way to experience the game for the first time. This leads to the other reason I'm happy I've watched his playthrough rather than stop and play the game myself, because in 3 days left I would have ignored Kel and missed the entire day.
  
  The way the game makes the initial main plot (Basil's disappearance) feel less important is phenomenal. Making the experiencer grasp to that plot line only for the characters to almost forget about it in the Last Resort, and then for the game to completely forsake it and reveal the truth in the last 2-3 hours of the game, punched really well. Headspace is reduced to Sunny's mechanism for ignoring the truth; Basil finding the picture containing a piece of it is the reason for his disappearance, and the rest of the characters forgetting about Basil is an additional measure the system takes to maintain the mechanism.

  I've read somewhere about a theory that Mari died only from the hanging, I didn't dive deeper into it as I admittedly intentionally don't want to encounter convincing evidence for that, but if Basil knew how to tie a hangman's knot and came up with the entire plan on the place, they probably also knew to check if Mari was actually dead. I don't see why it wouldn't be possible that she died form the fall; I recall that she had a permanent knee injury and landed on the violin, could have fallen and landed really badly.
  
  While Basil was capable of his doings, he was not able to fully comprehend them. Simply too young to understand the meaning difference between taking one's own life and an accident. Basil's plan was in good will, only for it to severely traumatize the two. The regrettable framing was what made the tragedy so much more poignant; the characters could never understand why, for that the tragedy lingered so harshly in their minds.

  Isolation seems like a fake way to deal with things, but it's easy to take and sometimes I used to find it hard to decline. Seeing Sunny's condition truly saddens me.

  On a final note, the bond between Sunny and Basil, is perfectly composed.

## The Last of Us Part II

Entry from 10-5-2024

Watched without commentary.

<summary>Spoliers:</summary>
  A criticism I've heard is about the lack of character development. This is true, none of the characters developed in a way that felt meaningful.
  
  Yet TLoU2 left with a powerful ending without character development. This is the first time I recognize a good story that its characters don't overcome challenging circumstances by changing. They actually don't overcome challenging circumstances in the first place. Rather, they stay the same, stuck in their perpetual cycle of retaliation, refusing to let go of their motives. This, is the opposite of character development; this, is the destruction of characters.

## Uncharted 1, 2, 3 and 4

  I recall hearing the story of Uncharted was worth watching. After doing so, I can tell these games are focused more on gameplay than narrative, and the story never really shines. But, the chemistry between the characters, which I felt more present in the first 3 games, was still quite fun to place in the background. 
  
  Uncharted 4 was a bit too long. Credit is where credit's due, its new antagonists and the fight between Rafe and Nathan at the end of the game were quite well written. The ending scene with Nathan's and Elana's daughter was the opposite, though. I really don't understand why they forced that into the game, especially considering the ending so far was as good as one could expect from such narrative.

# General Opinions

## Side Content

Entry from 11-5-2024

The side content of GTA 5 features funny, goofy characters. These side missions and the rest of San Andres have a lovable, thrilling charm, that is considerably distinct from the feel of the main content. You can trip out and hallucinate shooting clowns in a side mission, and then in a main mission commit torture, as the same character. The two scenes work well together because they provide contrast for each other. A wonderful example that doesn't work so well is Cyberpunk 2077.

Most of the side content in Cyberpunk 2077 attempts to provoke deep emotional responses, unsuccessfully. A side quest may have multiple parts, serious topics, a moral dilemma and choices, yet here I am following the fandom wiki to get the iconic weapon I want or the highest payment, unable to care less about this murderer character that now doubts he is the messiah. Johnny persuading the player to act according to his views may affect the player's choices, but the side quest still isn't compelling. With these failed attempts, adverse outcomes affect the main storyline itself:
- The world is blown out of proportion by inserting gratuitously complex conundrums, that regardless, are unexciting.
- The involved main characters feel fake by overreacting, with the aim to make the player care more about the side events.

Even when done successfully, this kind of side content can reduce the importance of the main storyline, potentially weakening it.

Humorous side content, on the other hand, can be done well with less steps, while emphasizing the main storyline via contrast, without affecting it or its characters directly.

I'm not sure what's preferable in a case where humorous side content doesn't fit. Perhaps abandoning side content altogether and going for a completely linear storyline, or separating side content into a small amount of quests that are long enough to achieve their purpose, is the way to go.

In a sense, this is a matter of quality over quantity. To make more serious side content, quality is tramendously more important than quantity. Humours side content allows for more quantity, which, for instance, can benefit open world games.
