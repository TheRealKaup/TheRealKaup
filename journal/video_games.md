# Notes 

This document is different than the other ones, as the content is video games rather than text, and I rate each entry and give my opinion on its narrative.

I also watch playthroughs, usually without commentary, instead of actually playing the video games, because I prefer to put them in the background and do something more productive in the foreground. Exceptions are detailed.

I have obviously played/watched more games that are unlisted here. I added only the ones that, since the creation of this list, my experience and memory of are still fresh, allowing me to give opinion.

# Will Watch

- Death Stranding

# S

## Omori

Watched CallMeCarson's playthrough.

I recommend CallMeCarson's playthrough if you like the niche content creator, the narration is really nice, but hide the chat from the VODs as it contains spoilers sometimes. Also, I've found I had to pay more attention than I've initially expected, because the scenes change quite quickly, dialogue is frequent and the more important bits blend with the others. I thought of switching from watching to playing the game a couple of times because my attention was already mostly drawn into it, but I didn't and I'm happy I didn't, as the actual gameplay experience, which is somewhat remote to undertale, isn't my cup of tee.
