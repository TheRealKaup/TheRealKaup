# Notes 

This document is different than the other ones, as the content is video games rather than text, and I rate each entry and give my opinion on its narrative.

I also watch playthroughs, usually without commentary, instead of actually playing the video games, because I prefer to put them in the background and do something more productive in the foreground. Exceptions are detailed.

I have obviously played/watched more games that are unlisted here. I added only the ones that, since the creation of this list, my experience and memory of are still fresh, allowing me to give opinion.

Spoilers ahead; tread carefully.
