# Notes 

This document is different than the other ones, as the content is video games rather than text, and I rate each entry and give my opinion on its narrative.

I also watch playthroughs, usually without commentary, instead of actually playing the video games, because I prefer to put them in the background and do something more productive in the foreground. Exceptions are detailed.

I have obviously played/watched more games that are unlisted here. I added only the ones that, since the creation of this list, my experience and memory of are still fresh, allowing me to give opinion.

# Will Watch

Entry from 9-5-2024

Watched CallMeCarson's playthrough.

I recommend CallMeCarson's playthrough if you like the niche content creator, the narration is really nice, but hide the chat from the VODs as it contains spoilers sometimes. Also, I've found I had to pay more attention than I've initially expected, because the scenes change quite quickly, dialogue is frequent and the more important bits blend with the others. I thought of switching from watching to playing the game a couple of times because my attention was already mostly drawn into it, but I didn't and I'm happy I didn't, as the actual gameplay experience, which is somewhat remote to undertale, isn't my cup of tee.

  So far the best written game I've experienced. In fact, the reason I created this file.

  CallMeCarson got the good ending with the secret Basil and Sunny cutscene at the end, which is basically the best way to experience the game for the first time. This leads to the other reason I'm happy I've watched his playthrough rather than stop and play the game myself, because in 3 days left I would have ignored Kel and missed the entire day.
  
  The way the game swayed on the surface from the initial main plot (Basil's disappearance) is phenomenal. Making the experiencer grasp to that plot line only for the characters to almost forget about it in the Last Resort, and then for the game to completely forsake it and reveal the truth in the last 2-3 hours of the game, punched really well. Later it's more clear that headspace is Sunny's mechanism to ignore the truth; Basil finding the picture containing a piece of it is the reason for his disappearance, and the rest of the characters forgetting about Basil is an additional measure the system takes to maintain the mechanism.

  I've read somewhere about a theory that Mari died only from the hanging, I didn't dive deeper into it as I admittedly intentionally don't want to encounter convincing evidence for that, but if Basil knew how to tie a hangman's knot and came up with the entire plan on the place, they probably also knew to check if Mari was actually dead. I don't see why it wouldn't be possible that she died form the fall; I recall that she had a permanent knee injury and landed on the violin, could have fallen and landed really badly.
  
  While Basil was capable of his doings, he was not able to fully comprehend them. Simply too young to understand the meaning difference between taking one's own life and an accident. Basil's plan was in good will, only for it to severely traumatize the two. The regrettable framing was what made the tragedy so much more poignant.

  There are ways I think about others that make me want to withdrawl from society as I know it, yet social needs are stronger opposing forces. Isolation seems like a fake way to deal with things, but it's easy to take and sometimes hard to decline. Seeing Sunny's condition truly saddens me.
