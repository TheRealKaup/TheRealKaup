# Notes

I usually skip over history parts.

In [Will Read](#will-read) I prefer listing Wikipedia outlines and lists rather than individual pages for topics that are newer to me, and the more I advance in the topic the more specific the pages listed here will be. I won't read all of the items in these lists, but rather I'll quickly go over them and pick pages that I find more interesting and relevant to me.
